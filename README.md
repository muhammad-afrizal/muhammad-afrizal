I'm Muhammad Afrizal, but you can call me Afrizal or Rizal. 
I'm currently a 5th-semester student at Pamulang University, with a keen interest in the world of technology. 
I'm especially excited about delving into the realm of Machine Learning. Currently, I'm deeply engaged in the Bangkit independent study program, focusing on the Machine Learning path, all in the spirit of learning and growth.
